\section{Introduction}

In this project, we focus on developing and optimizing a Python-based simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel heating method called Wall Heating, which uses interior walls as heat sources. Using the Modified Swiss Dwellings dataset, we simulate heating performance across thousands of building floorplans while prioritizing efficient code execution. The main goal is to ensure that our implementation is both scalable and computationally efficient to enable rapid evaluation across a large dataset.
